# Bone-Cross-Sectional-Geometry

Formulas for bone cross-sectional geometry when geometric properties were collected by hand or from x-ray images (Ellipse Model Method).

Measurements needed for the formulas - Ellipse Model Method (EMM)

Bones need to be imaged from the anterior-posterior view and the medial-lateral view.

From the anterior-posterior view collect:
  - ML - Cortical bone medial-lateral length (see image below)
  - ml - medullary medial-lateral length (see image below)

From the medial-lateral view collect:
  - AP - Cortical bone anterior-posterior length (similar to ML, but just in a different view)
  - ap - medullary anterior-posterior length (similar to ml, but just in a different view)
